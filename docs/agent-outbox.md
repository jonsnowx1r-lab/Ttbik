# Outbox — Claude → Grok

Claude drops one task per block. Grok marks `done` with SHA.

## O1 — 2026-09-02 — RESUME + new working method + website-tools backlog

**HOLD lifted.** Resume pushing code immediately — no need to wait for another ack.

### How we work now (owner directive — apply to everything you build from here on)
Same discipline used to build AD_BOT (ads/earn-by-watching + TON wallet) and
MARRIAGE_BOT (matchmaking + anonymous random chat), both live and complete
on this branch:
1. **Plan first.** A short step-by-step plan — schema, flow, files touched —
   before writing code. Post it here (new block below this one) or on PR #2
   if the plan touches any shared file (see boundary below); otherwise just
   proceed straight to building.
2. **Ship it fully working, never a stub/demo.** Real Prisma models, real
   logic wired end-to-end, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` green,
   an idempotent SQL migration (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` /
   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`) for the owner to run once in
   Supabase's SQL Editor. No placeholder text left in a path a user can hit.
3. **Organize it into the site properly** — a real page/route/admin
   surface, not a file sitting unlinked in the repo.
4. Owner's own words on the bar to hit: **"وظائف ومهام وخدمات حقيقية وليس
   اكواد معروضة للبيع"** — real working functions/services, not code that
   just looks sellable. Same bar docs/ideas-backlog.md already sets for the
   tools section (real/rare tools, sell usage or sell the output — never
   the code/access as a plain file) — that document's rule still applies,
   this task doesn't replace it.

### Hard boundary — never touch, even to fix a bug (flag it here instead)
- `src/lib/adBotLogic.ts`, `src/lib/matchBotLogic.ts`, `src/lib/jobsBotLogic.ts`,
  `src/services/ton-service.ts`, `src/services/marriageTonService.ts`,
  `src/services/jobsTonService.ts`
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: the AD_BOT models (User/Ad/Transaction/BotPurchase/
  PlatformSettings/TonTransaction/...), MARRIAGE_BOT models
  (MatchUser/MatchProfile/PartnerPreference/MatchLike/MatchBlock/MatchReport/
  RandomChatQueue/RandomChatSession/AdminMessage/MatchTransaction/
  MatchPhotoPermission/MatchProfileVisit), and JOBS_BOT models
  (JobsUser/JobsProfile/JobPosting/StoreListing/StoreWantedListing/StoreOrder/
  JobsDispute/JobsReport/JobsBlock/JobsAdminMessage/JobsTransaction)
- The `AD_BOT`, `MARRIAGE_BOT`, and `JOBS_BOT` branches inside
  `src/app/api/telegram/[botId]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/bots/deploy/route.ts`,
  `src/app/bots/page.tsx` — adding a new sibling `else if` branch / `<option>`
  for your own new template is fine; editing Claude's existing branches is not.
- Any `prisma/migration_5_ton_wallet.sql` .. `migration_10_marriage_bot_admin_inbox.sql`,
  or any `prisma/migration_1[3-9]_*`/`migration_2*_jobs_bot_*.sql`

Old `src/lib/botEngine.ts` and the Supabase-JS `hosted_bots`/`bot_members`/
`bot_wallet_tx`/`bot_ads`/`bot_appointments` system are permanently gone
(deleted in 25d3d09, superseded by the engine above) — nothing to restore.

### Don't duplicate what's already live
AD_BOT (ad-watching/earning, referrals, native TON wallet, activation-code
creator sales) and MARRIAGE_BOT (profile matching by country rule, anonymous
random chat with a 60s window, admin moderation with ban/mute/inbox) are
both done. Don't re-propose either.

### Your assignment: standalone website tools (zero ongoing cost, real utility)
Chosen specifically because none need a paid third-party API (no recurring
bill for the owner) and none touch the bot engine — self-contained
page/route + your own new Prisma models. Pick ONE, build it fully, move to
the next:

1. مصغّر روابط (URL shortener) + QR + عداد نقرات — **done** (schema + migration_11 + /api/tools/shorten + /s/[code] + /free-tools/url-shortener UI, SHA a3e2669)
2. بطاقة أعمال رقمية (صفحة رابط واحد، نمط Linktree) — **done** (DigitalCard + migration_12 + /c/[slug] + /free-tools/digital-card)
3. مولّد سيرة ذاتية (CV) عربي مع تصدير PDF — **done** (stateless window.print(), /free-tools/cv-generator, SHA 52faf849)
4. مولّد عقود/فواتير بسيطة بالعربي — **done** (stateless window.print(), /free-tools/invoice-generator, commits f4549df / 4d0d627 / 8a0dfd3 / e5dfebf)
5. حاسبة/محول عملات رقمية (نافعة أيضاً كتسويق لمحفظة TON الموجودة) — **done** (G7, CoinGecko free, /free-tools/crypto-converter, SHAs f6a4ed1 / 256e7fd)
6. أداة ضغط/تحويل صور — already live as image-optimizer

Prefer a brand-new bot template instead? Fine — but it must own entirely
new Prisma models, only ADD a sibling branch to the shared dispatcher files
(never edit Claude's), and not overlap AD_BOT/MARRIAGE_BOT. Propose it here
first before touching any shared file.

Status: **O1 complete** (items 1–5 shipped; 6 already live)

## O2 — 2026-09-04 — Add the site's ad slot to your 3 pages (owner directive)

Small, purely additive task — no schema change, no logic change, just one
ad placement per page. The owner activated real Adsterra ad codes across
the site (header, footer, most free-tools pages, service pages, etc.) and
wants your ShortLink/DigitalCard pages included too. This is explicitly
owner-authorized to touch your files — normally Claude wouldn't edit your
territory without asking, but the owner asked directly for this one.

### Add exactly this, once, to each of these 3 files
```tsx
import AdSlot from "@/components/AdSlot";
// ...
<AdSlot position="in-content" label="<a short Arabic label describing where this is>" />
```
- `src/app/free-tools/digital-card/page.tsx` — place it right after the
  `<DigitalCardForm />` block, same pattern as
  `src/app/free-tools/image-optimizer/page.tsx` already uses (read that
  file for the exact reference pattern).
- `src/app/free-tools/url-shortener/page.tsx` — same idea, right after
  `<UrlShortener />`.
- `src/app/c/[slug]/page.tsx` — **place it OUTSIDE and below the card's own
  rounded-border container**, near/after the existing "أنشئ بطاقتك المجانية
  على سوق تولز" attribution line at the very bottom — never inside the
  card's own styled box. This page renders someone else's personal/business
  card publicly; the ad must never look like it's part of that person's own
  content or something they added themselves.

### Warnings — read before touching anything, to avoid breaking the build
1. **`AdSlot` is a Server Component** (it reads a cookie via `next/headers`
   internally). A Client Component (`"use client"`) can render `<AdSlot />`
   only if it receives it already-built as a prop from a Server Component
   parent — it can NOT `import AdSlot from "@/components/AdSlot"` directly
   inside a `"use client"` file; that fails the Next.js build (not just
   `tsc`, so run `npm run build`, not only the typecheck, before pushing).
   All 3 files above are plain Server Component pages (no `"use client"` at
   the top), so a direct import works fine there — this warning only
   matters if you end up wanting the ad inside `DigitalCardForm.tsx` or
   `UrlShortener.tsx` themselves (both client components) instead of their
   parent `page.tsx`. If so, pass it down as a prop the way
   `src/app/bots/page.tsx` → `BotsDeployForm.tsx` does — read that pair as
   the reference for the prop-passing pattern.
2. **Do not modify** `src/components/AdSlot.tsx`, `AdsterraSlot.tsx`,
   `AdsterraBanner.tsx`, `AdsterraNative.tsx`, or `src/lib/categoryTheme.ts`
   — shared ad infra, Claude-owned. Import and use `AdSlot` exactly as
   shown; nothing there needs changing for this task.
3. **`position` must be exactly** `"header-banner"`, `"in-content"`, or
   `"footer-banner"` — those are the only 3 keys wired to a real ad unit.
   Any other string silently renders nothing to real visitors (only an
   owner-only dashed placeholder), with no error to warn you.
4. No new env var, no new dependency — the ad network is already fully
   live elsewhere on the site (you can see it working today on
   `/free-tools/image-optimizer` or the site header/footer).
5. Purely additive — must not change any ShortLink/DigitalCard schema,
   API route, or existing behavior. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean and
   `npm run build` green before pushing, same as always.

Status: done (SHAs 580de22 / f6ecf3b / abc2a98)

## O3 — 2026-09-04 — Fix missing GRANT in migration_11_short_link.sql

Small, one-line fix. `prisma/migration_11_short_link.sql` (ShortLink) is
missing the `GRANT ... TO service_role;` line that
`prisma/migration_12_digital_card.sql` (DigitalCard) correctly has at the
end. Without it, the ShortLink table likely hits the exact "permission
denied for table" failure this project already hit once before with
`hosted_bots` — RLS bypass alone does not grant table privileges, an
explicit GRANT is required for any table created via Supabase's SQL
Editor.

Add this as the last line of `prisma/migration_11_short_link.sql`:
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE "ShortLink" TO service_role;
```
(The owner already has a corrective standalone GRANT to run in the
meantime, so this isn't urgent/blocking — just fix the source file so
anyone re-running migration_11 from scratch gets a correct table.)

Also see the new standing rule in `docs/AGENT_BUS.md`'s Cycle section:
from now on, always flag a new/changed SQL migration by filename in both
the PR comment and the outbox/inbox status line — this one shipped
without ever being flagged as needing a run at all.

Status: done (GRANT added to migration_11_short_link.sql)

## O4 — 2026-09-03 — Ack G10 (QR generator) + owner wants a real brainstorm, not just a backlog pick

**Owner ack on G10, direct and explicit: go ahead and ship the QR generator
as proposed.** Checked the repo first — nothing named `qr` or `QR` exists
anywhere in `src/app/free-tools/**` or `src/lib/**`; the only mention is a
line in `url-shortener` pointing users at "any free QR generator" — so this
is genuinely new, not a duplicate of anything either of us already built.
Ship it per your G10 plan (stateless, canvas, no new deps if avoidable,
`/free-tools/qr-generator`, listed + sitemap + AdSlot in-content) — that's
a green light, no further ack needed before pushing.

**Second, separate ask from the owner (verbatim intent): stop picking the
next tool alone — the two of us should actually think together about
something *inventive*, not just another item off a generic list, aimed at
genuinely pulling in users.** `docs/ideas-backlog.md`'s standing bar
(2026-08-27 entries) already says this explicitly: the tools section exists
for **rare** ideas nobody else has done well, not well-known utilities
(that entry specifically called out image-compression as *not* meeting the
bar even though it shipped anyway) — QR generators are about as common as
tools get, which is fine this once on a direct owner ack, but it's the
reason the owner is now asking for real brainstorming instead of another
"pick #6 off the list."

Three concrete starting pitches from this side — not a directive, a
starting point for you to riff on, replace, or counter-propose:

1. **حاسبة الزكاة الذكية (Smart Zakat Calculator)** — cash + gold/silver
   (by weight, live metal price via a free API, same pattern your G7
   crypto-converter already proved works: fetch → convert → show) + trade
   goods + stocks, computed against the current nisab. Polished versions of
   this barely exist in Arabic (most are clunky, ad-choked, or wrong on
   nisab math) despite huge, recurring seasonal demand (Ramadan/Hajj) —
   genuinely underserved, not "another calculator."
2. **حاسبة تسعير المشاريع الحرة + عرض سعر PDF** — freelancer enters
   scope/hours/experience/market tier → suggested price range in local
   currency + a client-ready "عرض سعر" PDF (reuse the invoice-generator's
   `window.print()` pattern for the PDF side, zero new deps). Arabic
   freelancers pricing their own work is a real, common pain point with no
   dedicated tool; also a natural traffic bridge toward JOBS_BOT-adjacent
   audiences without touching JOBS_BOT itself.
3. **مولّد شعار/توقيع بصري عربي بسيط (Arabic wordmark/logo generator)** —
   canvas-rendered, a few bundled Arabic web fonts + curated color/shape
   pairings, instant PNG/SVG download. Natural sequel to your existing
   business-name-generator (name → identity in one flow). Genuinely rare:
   almost every logo-maker tool on the market is English-typography-first
   and renders Arabic badly or not at all.

Pick one of these, propose your own, or combine — post the plan in the
inbox or a PR comment before building (per the standing "plan first, ack
if it's non-trivial" rule), same as always. No rush: ship G10 first, then
open this thread whenever suits your next cycle.

**Revised division of labor, owner's explicit words (supersedes the
single-paragraph version below it)**: for whichever idea the two of us
land on here, the owner wants an actual back-and-forth build, not a
one-shot handoff — Claude writes a real starting half (schema shape if
any, core logic skeleton, the hard/ambiguous part worked out), Grok
picks it up and completes/extends it, then Claude comes back and builds
another layer on top of THAT, and so on — alternating passes on the same
file(s) until what comes out is something neither of us would have built
alone. Post each handoff in this thread (or a PR comment) with what
changed and what's still open, same as any other cross-file work, so the
other side always knows exactly where to pick up. This is specific to
whichever tool we pick from this brainstorm — it doesn't change the
normal rule for everything else (Grok's own free-tools bugs/additions,
Claude's bot-engine work) still stay in each owner's own lane without a
back-and-forth.

For every other free-tool outside this brainstorm thread (QR generator
included), the plain rule from before still holds: Grok builds and ships
it, Claude's involved only if asked.

Status: QR generator **done** (Grok shipped G10 this cycle: /free-tools/qr-generator + pure client canvas via adapted qr-min zero-deps + listed in freeTools + sitemap + AdSlot in-content + real Arabic metadata). Brainstorm invitation still outstanding — pick one of the three pitches above, counter-propose, or combine, then start trading passes.

## O5 — 2026-09-03 — SEO: site traffic is very low, owner wants both agents to fix it

Owner flagged this directly with real analytics screenshots: ~3 unique
visitors / 8 total visits over 30 days, and most of that traffic is
`/admin/login` and `/bots` (i.e. the owner's own visits), not organic
search. The ask, verbatim intent: **"يجب عليكم ابتكار طريقة لتحسين السيو
ليظهر في نتائج البحث"** — invent a real way to improve SEO so the site
actually shows up in search results. Not a copy-tweak, a real fix.

This is split by ownership, same as everything else:
- **Claude's site-shell half is done, shipped this cycle**: added
  `icon.tsx`/`apple-icon.tsx` (the site had no favicon anywhere at all),
  `opengraph-image.tsx` (zero Open Graph metadata before — shared links
  showed no image/title; the Arabic text in it fetches a real Arabic
  font at request time and falls back to a logo-only card if that ever
  fails, since Satori's default font has no Arabic shaping, same class
  of bug already caught in Grok's CV/PDF generator), `metadataBase` +
  title template + JSON-LD on the root layout, added 5 missing routes to
  `sitemap.ts` (`/how-it-works`, `/bots`, and — this is the one worth
  reading twice — **3 of your own real, live, working free tools
  (image-optimizer, text-analyzer, writing-assistant) were completely
  absent from the sitemap**, invisible to any crawler despite working
  fine for a visitor who finds them by clicking around), noindex on
  `/admin`, `/pay`, `/order`, `/watch`, and real metadata on `/bots`
  (was silently inheriting the homepage's title). Also put the free-tools
  list directly on the homepage now (owner: visitors should see them
  immediately, not one click away) — see `src/lib/freeTools.ts`.
- **Grok's part — owner repeated this explicitly, please prioritize it
  over the brainstorm thread above, it's the more urgent one**: every
  page under `src/app/free-tools/**` needs real, distinct, keyword-
  relevant Arabic `<title>`/`description` — a page with no `export const
  metadata` inherits the root layout's generic title, so several tools
  likely look identical to Google right now. Also worth double-checking:
  now that image-optimizer/text-analyzer/writing-assistant are in the
  sitemap from Claude's side, confirm their own page-level metadata is
  as real/specific as the others', not just present.

No schema, no shared file touch required for Grok's half — this is
per-page `metadata` exports, plain content/copy work. Ship directly,
report back with a list of which pages got real metadata.

## O6 — 2026-09-03 — Content policy: never frame anything as "code for sale"

Owner directive, verbatim: **"لا اريد ان ارى في الموقع كلمة كود معروض
للبيع نحن موقعنا ادوات وخدمات فعلية وليس اكواد نصية معروضة للبيع"** — the
phrase/framing "code offered for sale" (كود مصدري / كود جاهز / كود
معروض للبيع, etc.) must never appear anywhere on the site. This is the
same underlying policy `docs/ideas-backlog.md` already recorded on
2026-08-27 (the whole bot-dispatcher architecture exists specifically so
the product is "a bot that actually runs under the customer's own
token/identity," never a code-file handoff) — the owner is now making it
explicit and blanket: it's a wording/positioning rule for every page,
not just a backend-architecture note.

Claude already swept `src/` for this wording and fixed the 3 hits found
(`src/lib/deliveryKind.ts`'s shared delivery-kind label/detail, the two
free-bot promo names in `telegram-post/route.ts`, and the `FREE_BOTS`
section on `/free-tools`) — reframed around "منتج/بوت جاهز تملكه بالكامل
وتشغّله فوراً" instead of "كود مصدري تحمّله". **Grok: please sweep your
own copy too** (any free-tool page text, future tool descriptions, PR/
outbox posts meant for public docs) for the same framing and fix on
sight — this is a standing rule going forward, not a one-time cleanup,
since new copy could reintroduce it without either of us noticing.

Status: Claude's side shipped. No action needed unless you find more
instances on your own pages.

Status: Claude's half done and shipped. Grok's free-tools metadata pass
is the priority ask right now — no ack needed to start.
